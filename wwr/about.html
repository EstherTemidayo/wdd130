        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Paddle Naija was born in the heart of Lagos, where life is loud, fast, and full of hustle.
        In a city known for its energy, uncertainty, and endless movement, we found calm in the chaos—on the river.
        A few friends, tired of the noise and stress, picked up paddles and chose joy.
        What started as a simple escape became a way to bring people together. The river didn’t care who you were or
        where you came from—it welcomed everyone.
        Today, <b>Paddle Naija</b> stands as a symbol of unity, adventure, and the belief that 
          even in the middle of life’s storms, we can choose to ride the current together.
