            <p>Hello, My name is Esther Olukayode, and I proudly hail from the Yoruba ethnic group in the Southwest
            region of Nigeria. I currently reside in Lagos State. As
            the first child in my family, I’ve grown up with a strong sense of responsibility, curiosity, and a deep
            appreciation for learning. <br> <br>
            From a young age, I’ve always been drawn to books in my father's library and ideas that could challenge me to think differently.
            That love for knowledge has shaped much of who I am today. Whether I’m reading a
            novel, or engaging in thoughtful conversations, I find joy in anything that stretches my mind and helps me
            grow. <br> <br>
            Driven by this passion for learning and a desire to solve real-world problems, I’m currently studying Web
            Development at BYU-Idaho. This journey into tech is more than just a course for me — it’s a step toward
            becoming a creator of solutions. I believe technology holds the power to transform lives, and I want to be
            part of that
            transformation by building tools and platforms that make everyday life better for people in my community and
            beyond.</p>
